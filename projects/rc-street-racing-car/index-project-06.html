                            In this semester-long project, I was part of a
                            two-person team. We explored Bluetooth connectivity
                            with a controller and receiver by creating an
                            intuitive controller and a 3D printed street racing
                            car.

                        <p>
                            It was a challenging and rewarding project to work
                            on. We were learning about the concepts at the same
                            time we were designing and building it. There were
                            many iterations for the controller and for building
                            the car. However, it all started with the design. We
                            knew that there were two integral parts for the
                            whole idea to come together: the controller and the
                            receiver. I was mainly in charge of getting all the
                            components for both the controller and the car. Once
                            this was done I was tasked to develop and 3D print
                            the frame of the car and assemble it. In addition,
                            because we only had one breadboard for the
                            controller I created Jumper Connectors for the car.
                            Creating and documenting all the connections that
                            were needed for the car to function.

                        <h2>The controller</h2>
                        <p>
                            We wanted the controller to be very intuitive for
                            the user from the get-go. This is why we placed our
                            Arduino Nano 33 BLE on a breadboard and we used the
                            gyroscope information to determine the direction of
                            the car, this way the user could be holding the
                            breadboard as a wheel to control the car. The next
                            thing we did was to use a pressure pad to simulate
                            the acceleration from a pedal in a car, and used an
                            LED bar graph as feedback so that the user could see
                            how fast they were going by looking at how many
                            lights on the bar graph were turned on, the more
                            lights the faster the car was going. And finally we
                            used a button and a single RGB LED light to indicate
                            if the car was on or off.

                        <p>
                            As for the car itself, we 3D printed all of the
                            pieces and assembled them to accommodate the
                            components. Because the Arduino Pro mini did not
                            possess an inbuilt Bluetooth module such as the
                            Arduino Nano 33 BLE board we had to connect an
                            external module, this way information could be
                            received from the controller. To manage the DC
                            motor, for propulsion, and the servo for the
                            direction we used a dual-motor driver. We used the
                            AA battery cases to power the Arduino Pro Mini board
                            and a 9.0 battery clip to power the servo and the DC
                            motor.

                                Power on both the car and the controller. You
                                should see the car's flashing light.

                                When the car's LED stops blinking, and the
                                controller's LED is green, you can start
                                driving:

                                    To turn left or right, tilt the controller

                                    To stop, click the stop button. The

                                    To start, click the stop button again. The

                        <p>
                            Building an idea is an iterative process. We started
                            modifying the base 3D model in slicer files to fit
                            in our motor and servo. We then assembled the
                            Arduino Pro Mini, the TB6612FNG H-bridge Motor
                            Driver, and the HM-18 Bluetooth module and later
                            designed a flexible schematic to keep track of the
                            wiring and update in case of needs. On the software
                            side, we programmed and tested the logic of the
                            boards that communicate via Bluetooth, the Arduino
                            Pro Mini, and the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, which
                            was challenging due to the required correct voltage,
                            Bluetooth unreliability, and on-board pins
                            limitation. Overall, two key challenges and
                            takeaways are Bluetooth connection (reliable
                            communication between a controller and a receiver)
                            and hardware debugging (such as testing that all the
                            wires pass electricity, proper grounding, etc.)
