                            develop a mobile application prototype. The goal of
                            the project was to create a user-friendly app that
                            would help students and staff locate hydration
                            stations on the UMass campus.

                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <h3>1.1 Problem Statement</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our team has conducted a comprehensive analysis of
                            the accessibility of hydration stations on the UMass
                            campus and has identified a significant issue that
                            requires immediate attention. Despite the presence
                            of numerous hydration stations throughout the
                            campus, students and visitors encounter considerable
                            difficulty in locating them due to the lack of clear
                            and readily accessible information. This deficiency
                            poses a particular challenge when attempting to find
                            hydration stations within unfamiliar buildings,
                            consequently causing inconvenience, especially for
                            individuals with limited time availability due to
                            demanding academic schedules.
                        </p>
                        <h3>1.2 Previous Solutions</h3>
                        <p>
                            Currently, UMass provides a spreadsheet containing
                            the locations of all hydration stations on campus;
                            however, this approach fails to deliver a
                            user-friendly experience and presents difficulties
                            in locating and comprehending the necessary
                            information. Consequently, students often resort to
                            purchasing plastic bottled water, thereby incurring
                            financial costs and contributing to the pervasive
                            issue of single-use plastic waste, which poses
                            significant environmental challenges.
                        </p>
                        <h3>1.3 Our Solution</h3>
                        <p>
                            In light of this predicament, our team is driven to
                            resolve this problem by developing and implementing
                            an innovative mobile application specifically
                            designed to address the aforementioned issues. This
                            application will offer students clear and
                            user-friendly information concerning the exact
                            locations of hydration stations across the UMass
                            campus. By providing this essential resource, our
                            solution aims to encourage and facilitate healthy
                            hydration habits, diminish reliance on plastic
                            bottled water, and actively contribute to the
                            establishment of a more sustainable environment.
                        </p>
                        <h3>1.4 Motivation</h3>
                        <p>
                            Our endeavor is motivated by our unwavering
                            commitment to enhancing the quality of life for
                            students on campus and our ardent dedication to
                            forging a more sustainable future. Our proposed
                            solution aligns seamlessly with the ongoing
                            initiatives at UMass, such as the
                            <b>UMass Zero Waste</b>
                            initiative and the
                            <b>Campus Race to Zero Waste 2023</b>
                            competition. The Campus Race to Zero Waste
                            competition stands as a national platform that
                            empowers colleges and universities to advance their
                            waste reduction efforts, encompassing vital aspects
                            such as campus recycling and food waste diversion.
                            By addressing the accessibility of hydration
                            stations, our project aligns harmoniously with the
                            overarching goals of these initiatives, amplifying
                            their impact and propelling UMass toward greater
                            sustainability and environmental stewardship.

                        <p>
                            In the early development of an app, stories and
                            personas play a crucial role in building a
                            user-centered product. These personas are fictional
                            characters representing different user types likely
                            to use the app. Personas help developers understand
                            user needs, motivations, and behaviors.

                        /></span>
                        <p>
                            For our first persona, we created Walt Jr. a highly
                            active nursing student here at the University of
                            Massachusetts Amherst. Walt goes to the gym, runs,
                            and plays sports and therefore is always trying his
                            best to stay hydrated. However, he always gets
                            frustrated as he cannot find the hydration stations
                            around campus. This prevents him from reaching his
                            goals and he is always trying to find a better way
                            to keep track or find new water stations around
                            campus. This is why Walt Jr. is a great primary
                            persona, as his goals and frustrations line up with
                            what we wish to solve and our app will satisfy his
                            needs and help him stay hydrated throughout the day.
                        </p>

                        /></span>
                        <p>
                            For our second persona, we created Skylar White, an
                            environmental science student here at the University
                            of Massachusetts Amherst. While she is not as active
                            as Walt Jr. she has other reasons for using our app
                            to satisfy her goals. Skylar is frustrated at the
                            rate at which global warming and other environmental
                            factors are becoming more and more of an issue but
                            since she is an active player on campus when it
                            comes to environmental activism and awareness, she
                            does her best to make her voice heard. Specifically,
                            Skylar wants to support the UMASS Zero Waste
                            Initiative by promoting the use of hydration
                            stations around campus. Therefore, our app idea
                            would be an excellent tool for her to get one step
                            closer to her goals and promote the use of hydration
                            stations by students here at UMASS.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Features</h2>
                        <p>
                            From task 1 (Walt Jr., Gym) we realized most of the
                            buildings have multiple hydration stations. It would
                            be a good idea to have a digital Hydration Station
                            <b>Map</b> on our application. This map will show
                            the locations of all the hydration stations at that
                            particular building. This will help a person locate
                            the nearest station easily, no matter where they are
                            in the building.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From task 2 (Skylar White), we realized that our
                            application could also include a
                            <b>search function</b> that allows students to
                            search for hydration stations based on location or
                            other criteria. For example, they could search for
                            stations near a particular building or those with a
                            specific type of water filtration system.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From task 3 (Walt Jr., UMASS Track Team), we
                            realized that our application could include a
                            nearest hydration station functionality, this is a
                            feature that automatically uses the person's current
                            location to give the user a list of the
                            <b
                                >top 10 nearest hydration stations based on
                                their location.</b
                            >
                            This goes well with our second feature from task 2,
                            in case a user does not want the application to use
                            their current location, then they could use the
                            search functionality described in task 2.

                                For our low-fidelity prototypes, we quickly drew
                                what our app would look like on paper. We used
                                this to get a general idea of what we wanted our
                                app to look like and what features we wanted to
                                include.

                                For our mid-fidelity prototype, we used
                                <b>Figma</b>
                                because it was easy to use and fitted our needs
                                the most out of the other tools we could have
                                chosen. Our prototype depicts the following
                                tasks: a main page that the user sees when they
                                open the app, a search function that will let
                                users search for a specific building when they
                                choose to use the app without location tracking,
                                general settings related to the app, user
                                settings to change the username, and an
                                information page for users to see the specific
                                water fountain they are looking for. We learned
                                through this process that we could take out some
                                things that we planned on earlier, but realized
                                were not needed for the final product that we
                                wanted to release.

                            hydration stations across campus. With the Map Page,
                            they can see where they are located as well as where
                            each station is located in real-time. Furthermore,
                            with the Search Page, a user can search for and find
